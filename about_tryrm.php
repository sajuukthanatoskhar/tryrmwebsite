  <p>There are plenty of positions going in TRYRM at present.  We don't take Alpha Accounts unless you are known and vouched for by an existing TEST member and Sajuukthanatoskhar thinks all parties are okay.
  In addition, TRYRM does not accept J4Gs and has some rigid requirements regarding application processes and being socially integrated into the alliance.</p>
  </div>
  <p>These are stated very clearly in the Message of the Day in the ingame channel '<strong>TRYRM Public</strong>' </p>
